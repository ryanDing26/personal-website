      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <section id="about">
        <p>
          Having always been good at math and reasoning in grade school, I decided to take my inclinations one step further into a 
          degree in computer science at <a href="">UC San Diego</a>. I am fascinated with what the future of artificial intelligence and software engineering 
          has to offer, and I am constantly refining myself as a programmer and as a person, seeking to become a T-shaped developer in both fields 
          and to practice good personal habits for myself and my community.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not developing new things, you can find me dancing in my room, playing with my dog, or trying out a new restaurant!
